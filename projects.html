        <h1>Welcome to my projects!</h1>
        <p>So far I have done a couple of projects whilst being in Neumont and will display them here.</p>

        <h2>My casino game</h2>
        <img src="./images/casinogame.png"/>
        <br>
        <p>This project was made in Intro to Computer Science and was actually the final project for that class where we had to pick something we wanted to make
            and do so using andriod studio. It took a while to make as well as made it difficult for me to code it within what time we had. I got most of the game completed
            however the dice game would break sadly. First you would pick a game by clicking on the button, it'll bring you to a screen that'll let you 
            either start that game or read the rules for the game. The card game is a game where you draw a card and the computer draws a card, if you get a higher card then you win $150
            otherwise you lose. The fortune wheel has you "spin" which just calls a random function and depending on whatever number you get you get a certain amount of money.
        </p>

        <h2>My about me website</h2>
        <img src="./images/html.png"/>
        <br>
        <img src="./images/mypage.png"/>

        <p>This was one of my first projects in the Intro to Web class, and is how I am currently building this website. There's not much to see but it just goes
            through the different pages that I have linked in the header above and each page has some different content.
        </p>

        <h2>Creating a college</h2>
        <img src="./images/labTwo.png"/>
        <nr></nr>
        <p>
            This project was created in the class OOP (Object Oriented Programming) where it would ask you for the name of the college, and then let you add
            all the different things inside it. Mainly the students, faculty, staff, and the courses.
