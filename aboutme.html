        <h1>
            Welcome to the about me page! 
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Some things about me would be that I have been wanting to make my own video games ever since I was 8 or so and thanks to my first time diving into code
            back in 9th grade I have been wanting to do this even more. Now that I am in Neumont I will make sure that I succeed in my dream no matter what challenges may
            face my way.
        </p>
        <p>
            My interests outside of coding and gaming can be quite interesting so I'll list a few
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Cats, my favourite animal since they are so adorable
            </li>
            <li>
                Gothic lolita style for clothing and decoration since I think it fits me quite well and it is unique to a lot of different styles in my opinion
            </li>
            <li>
                I really like watching baking videos since bakery art is very beautiful and I would like to do something of the sort in the future
            </li>
            <li> 
                I love nature and would be really happy if I was able to have some kind of garden in my backyard when I get my own house
            </li>
        </ul>
