        <p>
            Here I will talk about my skills that I have and obtained so far at Neumont.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been able to learn a few coding languges, ie Java, Python, Javascript, and HTML. I have some good team skills as well as communication skills.
            Over the years I have noticed that I can adapt pretty quickly to new things as well as being able to type fast at a rate of 72 words per minute.
            Have been able to impact others positively and inspire them.
